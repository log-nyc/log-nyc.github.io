talk_title: "Algorithmic Challenges from the FlyWire Connectome"
abstract: "The recently complete FlyWire connectome of the fruit fly brain presents unique opportunities and challenges for graph algorithms. With millions of synaptic connections between ~140,000 neurons, it dwarfs previous connectomes and demands new computational approaches. We will delve into the structure of this real-world biological network, and explore active data challenges related to graph clustering, matching, and sorting."
bio: "Arie Matsliah is a research scientist at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, where he leads efforts to disseminate the recently published FlyWire full brain connectome. Arie is the creator of FlyWire Codex and the organizer of the FlyWire data challenges, which use combinatorial optimization methods to tackle questions about the connectome. Arie holds a Ph.D. in computer science focused on graph property testing and approximation algorithms for large datasets. Before joining PNI Arie worked at IBM Research, Google, and multiple startups."
