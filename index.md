## About

The New York Metropolitan Area Regional Workshop of the [Learning on Graphs Conference](https://logconference.org/) is a semiannual research workshop on topics broadly related to machine learning on graphs and geometry. 

### Subject Areas

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of our workshop's research focus:

- Expressive graph neural networks
- GNN architectures (e.g., transformers, new positional encodings, etc.)
- Statistical theory on graphs
- Causal inference and causal discovery (e.g., structural causal models, causal graphical models, etc.)
- Geometry processing and optimization
- Robustness and adversarial attacks on graphs
- Combinatorial optimization and graph algorithms
- Graph kernels
- Graph signal processing and spectral methods
- Graph generative models
- Scalable graph learning models and methods
- Graphs for recommender systems
- Knowledge graphs
- Neural manifold
- Self-supervised learning on graphs
- Structured probabilistc inference
- Graph/Geometric ML (e.g., for health applications, security, computer vision, etc.)
- Graph/Geometric ML infrastructures (e.g., datasets, benchmarks, libraries, etc.)
